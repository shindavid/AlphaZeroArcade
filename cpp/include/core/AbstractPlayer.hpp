 * Base class for all players.
 *
 * There are 4 main virtual functions to override:
 *
 * - start_game()
 * - receive_state_change()
 * - get_action_response()
 * - end_game()
 *
 * start_game() and end_game() are called when a game starts or ends. A single player might play
 * multiple games in succession, so you should override this method if there is state that you want
 * to clear between games.
 *
 * receive_state_change() is called when the game state changes. This is where you should update
 * your internal state. Note that you get this callback even after you make your own turn as a sort
 * of "echo" of your own action.
 *
 * get_action_response() is called when it is your turn to make a move. This is where you should
 * return the action that you want to take.
 *
 * TODO: for imperfect-information games, these methods should accept an "information set", rather
 * than a State. Flush out the details of this if/when we get there.
