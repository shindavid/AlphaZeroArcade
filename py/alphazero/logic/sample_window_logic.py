"""
This module contains logic for maintaining the sampling window.

There is an ever-growing master-list M of all positions. Within M, there is a most-recently
selected sample window, W = M[a:b]. The positions of W have been sampled an average of r times each.

The next window to use will be W' = M[c:] for some c.

Here is a diagram of the above:

                                    [---------W'---------]
                              [--------W---------]
M: ---------------------------+-----+------------+-------+
                              a     c            b       n

Given W (represented by {a, b, r}), at what point can we start sampling the next window (W')?

This module provides functionality for answering this question.

class Window:

    In the notation of the diagram above, this class represents a window W = M[a:b] together with a
    sample rate r.

    Assuming a constant r for the entire window is a simplification that makes the math easier. This
    will tend to overestimate the end of the window and underestimate the start of the window.

    This simplification is reasonable because as the sample window slides forward, each position
    slides from the end of the window to the start of the window, and so the overestimates and
    the underestimates will approximately cancel out.

    samples for the next window.

    For special cases like FixedSamplingMethod, we can of course solve this more directly. But
